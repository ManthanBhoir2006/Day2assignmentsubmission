 Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that we’re gonna be working with and storing 
in variables. In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic 
types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive 
data types. A single variable can only store a single type of data. That means it’s important for 
you to learn to store the data correctly.The computer is gonna identify what type of data you’re 
working with based off of the syntax, or the way that you write the code. It’s important that you 
remember and practice these differences, otherwise, data could get stored in an improper format and 
bite you later. 

 Strings are collections of alphanumeric characters and symbols. This is how we’re gonna store letters 
and words. Things like addresses. Numbers are just what they sound like. They’re numbers, including 
both integers and decimals. Computers will often use numbers to perform mathematical operations, but 
they may also just be a number like a count of how many flavors of ice cream a particular store has.
Booleans can only have two values. True and false. They represent all data that only has two states, 
like a light switch. On or off. The undefined data type means that the variable has been created, but 
has never been given a value. It is nothing because no one has ever bothered to tell it what value it 
should be. Null is similar to undefined, except it has to be set intentionally. It also means empty or 
nothing, but it’s that way because a developer told it it was empty or nothing.
