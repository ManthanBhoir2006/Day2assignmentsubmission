A console table is a table whose top surface is supported by corbels or brackets rather 
than by the usual four legs. It is thus similar to a supported shelf and is not designed to 
serve as a stand-alone surface. It is frequently used as pier table 
(which may have legs of any variety), to abut a pier wall.
